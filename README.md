Docker Images Without Docker
Docker is a popular containerization platform that allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into portable and lightweight containers. Docker images are the building blocks of these containers and contain everything that is needed to run the application, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

While Docker has gained popularity among developers and DevOps engineers, not everyone may have access to a Docker environment or may prefer not to use it for various reasons. However, there are alternative ways to create and manage container images without using Docker.

In this blog, we’ll explore some of these methods and show you how to create container images without Docker.

Buildah
Buildah is a command-line tool that allows you to build and manage container images without a Docker daemon. It uses the same technology as Docker, including OCI (Open Container Initiative) and image layering, but doesn’t require Docker installed on your system.

With Buildah, you can create images from scratch or base them on existing images, add layers, install software, configure settings, and export them as OCI-compliant images. You can also push your images to a registry or use them to create containers using other container runtimes such as Podman or CRI-O.

Here’s an example of how to create a simple image with Buildah:

# Create a new container and install some software
buildah from scratch
buildah run mycontainer yum install -y nginx

# Commit the changes to a new image
buildah commit mycontainer myimage

# Export the image as a tarball
buildah push myimage docker://myregistry/myimage
2. Kaniko

Kaniko is a tool that enables you to build Docker images without requiring Docker installed or running as a privileged user. It uses a Dockerfile as input and builds the image within a containerized environment.

Kaniko can be used with any container registry and supports various build options such as caching, parallel builds, and build arguments. It also has a CLI and can be integrated with CI/CD systems such as Jenkins and GitLab.

Here’s an example of how to use Kaniko to build an image:

# Build the image with Kaniko
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/workspace gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:latest \
    --dockerfile=Dockerfile \
    --context=/workspace \
    --destination=myregistry/myimage:latest

# Push the image to a registry
docker push myregistry/myimage:latest
3. Podman

Podman is a container engine that provides a Docker-compatible CLI and can be used to create, run, and manage containers and images. It doesn’t require a daemon or root privileges, making it a good alternative for developers who want to avoid Docker’s complexity and security risks.

Podman also supports the Dockerfile format and can build images from scratch or base them on existing images. It uses the same OCI-compliant image format as Docker and can interact with Docker registries and networks.

Here’s an example of how to use Podman to build an image:

# Build the image with Podman
podman build -t myimage .

# Push the image to a registry
podman push myregistry/myimage:latest
4. Singularity

Singularity is a container platform that is designed for scientific computing and high-performance computing (HPC) environments. It allows users to create and run containers without requiring root privileges, making it a good option for multi-user environments. Singularity supports Docker images and can be used to run them without Docker.

In conclusion, while Docker is a popular tool for working with container images, there are alternatives available for those who don’t have access to Docker or who prefer not to use it. Buildah, Podman, Singularity, and Kaniko are all viable options for working with Docker images without using Docker itself. By using these tools, you can still benefit from the flexibility and portability of containerization without relying on Docker.
